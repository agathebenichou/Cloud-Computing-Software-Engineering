The purpose of this assignment was to provide and invoke a RESTful API that allowed users to:
- Create and store dishes
- Create and store meals
- Retrieve, update and delete dishes and meals

Additionally, use Docker containers to package the application

Source Code:
- main.py is the main script the establishes the Flask app and associates resources with classes
- model.py is the data model that defines the Dish and Meal classes that define the REST methods
- collection.py is the collection model that defines the data structure operations on the back end of the REST methods

To package and run the application:

1. Unzip the tar file containing source code and Docker file
2. Open terminal and access the directory of the unzipped file (now a folder)
3. Build the Docker image: "docker build --tag meals ." (Requires Docker Desktop to be launched)
4. Run the Docker container: "docker run -p 8000:8000 meals" (Instructing Docker to run on port 8000)
5. Invoke the API through Postman, Insomnia or the URL. It can be called through: http://localhost:8000/
The resources are defined in the model class.
